Homework #4

CrystalCollect is a game assigment using jquery.

I've based the design around Bootstrap elements. The predifined classes may cause some issue but has yet to be determined.

Premise of the game is to match your score with a randomly generated computer score. Number will be chosen upon the start of each game and will be between 19-120.

you increase your score by clicking a crystal, each with a randomly generated value of 1-12 set each game.

If by determining the value of the cyrstals you can match you score to that of the computer, you win!

if you go over the computer's score, you lose :(

Wins and losses will be tallied at the bottom of the page.
